    abstract = {{This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition. The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednault's ADL [10] for propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP [6] for actions. Our hope is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.}},
